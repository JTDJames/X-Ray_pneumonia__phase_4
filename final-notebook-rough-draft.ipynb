    "Pneumonia is the primary cause of childhood hospitalization [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25695124/). Pediatric pneumonia is lethal without proper treatment, accounting for 15% of all childhood deaths [[2]](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia).  As the disease progresses, pediatric pneumonia requires a significant amount of hospital resources for treatment and poses a high cost of care for patients [[3]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352646719300274). Therefore, timely and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is critical for successful treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many complications to quickly and accurately diagnosing pneumonia. To determine the right treatment protocol, doctors need to determine whether pneumonia is *bacterial* or *viral* [[4]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1405870). Clinical features alone are not sufficient to accurately diagnose pneumonia [[5]](https://pneumonia.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.15172/pneu.2014.5/464#Sec4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Chest X-Ray evaluation is the current gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia [[6]](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/31/2/347/293404). However, this method has key limitations. Chest X-ray interpretation is labor intensive and prone to human error; there is a shortage of radiologists with sufficient training to read chest X-rays[[7]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00106-0/fulltext). Even for experienced radiologists, reliability and accuracy scores range from 38-76% [[8]](https://www.ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/AJR.19.21521).\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence can improve the process of diagnosing pneumonia accurately and efficiently. Computer aided diagnostic systems have shown reasonable accuracy in detecting infections from X-rays. When aided by AI, radiologists are significantly more accurate at diagnosing pneumonia compared to unassisted[[9]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00106-0/fulltext). Computerized models can increase the overall efficiency of the diagnostic process by reducing work burden on radiologists. Quicker detection allows doctors to start treatment protocol sooner, which can reduce severity and duration of illness.  "
